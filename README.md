# clist

Simple doubly-linked list implementation, all functions can be ran against any
list node in the list safely.

No function to insert before/after a node/value yet, as it's not necessary for
[cecse](https://github.com/MatthewOwens/cecse) currently.

Interface can be found in [clist.h](src/clist.h)
